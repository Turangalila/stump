Online sheet music editor.

## Proposal 

- Application strictly client-side. Based on HTML5, SVG, CSS3 and Javascript
- WYSIWYG interface, with at least viewing the page format
- Tool as fullest as possible elements of musical notation
- Freedom for manipulation of graphic elements
- Enable import MusicXML 3.0 and MIDI
- Export to PDF using the library [jsPDF] (https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF)

## Reason 

There are some tools available in the market editing score, paid and free, which 
supply most of the needs of those seeking writing scores. However almost all of 
these tools available are very concerned with keeping track of the elements of 
musical notation for mainly export or interpret content in audible file. 

Thus, the editors available for use become very inflexisveis, and consequently 
requires much learning time by the user, in addition to greatly limit notations 
fleeing the basics. 

This tool can help anyone make their musical notes quickly and flexibly, without 
taking too much time learning. Also can be used as an extension tool for anyone 
who wants to create music with unusual notations and complex graphics.
